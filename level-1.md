* **Encoding**

   is for maintaining data _usability_

   and can be reversed by employing the same algorithm that encoded the content, i.e. no key is used.

* **Encryption**
   is for maintaining data _confidentiality_
   and requires the use of a key \(kept secret\) in order to return to plaintext.
* **Hashing**
   is for validating the _integrity_
   of content by detecting all modification thereof via obvious changes to the hash output.
* **Obfuscation**
   is used to _prevent people from understanding_
   the meaning of something, and is often used with computer code to help prevent successful reverse engineering and/or theft of a productâ€™s functionality.





One might ask when obfuscation would be used instead of encryption, and the answer is that obfuscation is used to make it harder for one entity to understand \(like a human\) while still being easy to consume for something else \(like a computer\). With encryption, neither a human or a computer could read the content without a key.
